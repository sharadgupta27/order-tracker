# Homework 4: DevOps and Observability for AI-Built Apps

In this homework, you'll investigate a failure in [Order Tracker](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/order-tracker), a small app for creating orders and checking their status. The starter has a web page, API, tests, and a Docker Compose setup.

Fork the starter on GitHub, then clone your fork. You'll add observability and an incident responder that reacts to an alert. Ask your coding agent to help with the implementation, but check each result yourself.

You need Docker with Compose and Python with `uv` for the tests. The starter's README explains how to run it.

## Question 1: Run the app

Start Order Tracker:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d --wait
```

Now check it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
```

What does the health check return?

- `{"status":"ok"}`
- `{"status":"error"}`
- `{"orders":3}`
- `pong`

For this and the next questions, you can ask your coding assistant to help select the correct option.

**Answer:** `{"status":"ok"}`

==============================================================================

## Question 2: Instrument one endpoint

Imagine a customer says they cannot open an order. You check the website and everything looks okay. We need a better way to undestand what's happening in the system. For that we use metrics, logs and traces.

Ask your agent to add OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, and traces for order lookups. The request metric should include the route and HTTP status code.
For now, export the signals to the console so you can inspect them with `docker compose logs app`.

After the agent's changes, rebuild the app with `docker compose up --build -d --wait`.

Then lookup the order `standard-1001`:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8000/api/orders/standard-1001
```

Find the request metric in the app logs.

Which HTTP status code does the metric record for this lookup?

- 200
- 301
- 404
- 500

**Answer:** 200

==============================================================================

## Question 3: Build the telemetry pipeline

In Question 2, we looked at the logs to see the telemetry. Let's now save it into a proper telemetry storage.

Ask your agent to add an OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and Grafana to Docker Compose. Send the app's metrics, logs, and traces through the Collector, and create a Grafana dashboard for request counts and errors. Save the configuration in your repository.

Rebuild the stack with `docker compose up --build -d --wait`, then run:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8000/api/orders/standard-1002
```

In Grafana, find the request metric for this lookup. Check that its log and trace also appear. Which HTTP status code does the metric show?

- 404
- 200
- 301
- 500

**Answer:** 404 (`standard-1002` does not exist in the seed data, so the request metric records 404)

==============================================================================

## Question 4: Configure the alert

The dashboard shows errors when you open it, but it does not notify anyone on its own. An alert watches the `5xx` metric and changes state when server errors occur. Later, Grafana will send an HTTP request called a webhook to the responder so it can start investigating automatically.

Ask your agent to add a Grafana alert for `5xx` responses. Include the endpoint, time window, and dashboard link in the alert, and handle periods with no `5xx` responses. For now, check the alert's state in Grafana. You will connect it to the responder in Question 6.

Run the lookup from Question 3 again:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8000/api/orders/standard-1002
```

Wait for the alert to evaluate. What state does Grafana show?

- Normal
- Firing
- Pending
- No data

**Answer:** Normal. A 404 is not a 5xx, so the alert stays Normal. (It shows "Normal (NoData)" until a 5xx occurs, because the rule treats no data as OK. After a 500 from `express-1002` it changed to Firing.)

==============================================================================

## Question 5: Build the automatic responder

When an alert fires, the on-call engineer needs to look into it and solve it. If they cannot do it, they escalate it to developers.

In our case, we'll have an agent that's doing exactly that.

Ask your coding assistant to build a service in `incident-response/` that receives alerts from Grafana at `POST /alerts` on port `8001`. When an alert arrives, it should save the information needed to understand the problem, such as the affected endpoint, logs, and traces.

On alert, the service should start the coding assistant automatically in headless mode.

When it's done, start the responder. We want to test it. Send an alert to the responder:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/alerts \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"alerts":[{"status":"firing","labels":{"alertname":"ResponderTest","test":"true"},"annotations":{"summary":"Test notification; no incident to fix"}}]}'
```

Wait for the agent to finish, then read its response.

What did the agent respond? Include the last line from its answer.

**Answer:** The agent's response ended with the last line `RESULT: NO_CHANGE`. It treated the alert as a test (`labels.test: "true"`) and changed no files. Full response: `incident-response/incidents/20261005-204133-ResponderTest-416e80/agent-output.txt`.

==============================================================================

## Question 6: Watch the agent fix the incident

Now test the complete flow with a real Grafana alert.

Connect the Grafana alert to the responder through a webhook.

Let's make this request:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8000/api/orders/express-1002
```

This request is problematic and should cause the alert to fire. If it doesn't repeat it multiple times. Then watch Grafana send the webhook to `/alerts`, and the responder start automatically.

Wait for the agent to fix the problem, restart the app and verify that the same request doesn't cause the problem to appear.

What was the problem?

- The express delivery date calculation tried to use a day that does not exist in that month.
- The order timestamp could not be parsed because it had no time zone.
- The app rejected the order's `preparing` status.
- The lookup searched the wrong database column for express orders.

**Answer:** The express delivery date calculation tried to use a day that does not exist in that month.

The app's log showed `ValueError: day is out of range for month`. The seeded `express-1002` order was created on 2026-09-30, and `placed_at.replace(day=placed_at.day + 2)` produced day 32. The agent's fix changes it to `placed_at + timedelta(days=2)`. After the restart, `express-1002` returns 200 and its estimated delivery is 2026-10-02. The incident evidence is in `incident-response/incidents/20261005-204359-Order-Tracker-5xx-responses-dee59e/`.
